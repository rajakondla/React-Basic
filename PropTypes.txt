1) PropTypes used for props validation
2) Eg: propTypes:{
      author:React.PropTypes.object.isRequired,
	  onSave:React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
	  validate:React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
	  errors:React.PropTypes.object,
	  hasErrors:React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
   }
3) For preformance, prop validation or prop types runs in only development version of react. So document all issues in development.
4) Every prop type that is not required, should have a backing field to get default props.
5) Top level component also called Controller View. Controller View passes data down to child components using props.
6) Mixins share behavior among many components.
